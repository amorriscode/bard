The Internet is filled with great content. But not all great content is rewarded.

Bard is a tool designed for writers around the world to earn an income from their words. It's meant to be lightweight, easy to use, and just flexible *enough*. Everything is in service of the words on the page.

Gone are the days of needing a developer to deploy, maintain, and tweak your website. Gone are the days of giving your up a share of your earnings.

Focus on your work, let Bard handle the rest.
